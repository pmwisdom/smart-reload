Smart Reload Alpha Build! A Plugin Allows You to control when auto update gets pushed out to your clients.

What does Smart Reload Do For You?

Smart Reload attempts to solve the problem of annoying mid-page auto updates from the server, while still keeping your clients
updated with your latest code. Its highly customizable so you choose exactly when you want your clients to update, all
without the clients needing to do anything. This is most important on mobile devices, where your app store app might be
much farther behind where the latest version of the updated app is at.

Features:
    * Force update on First Start of App (Ensures that the application will start with the most up to date code possible)
    * Wait To Update if a certain Selector is present in the app (forms, inputs, etc ... stuff you dont want to refresh while your user is entering information)
    * Wait To Update if a user is on a certain Page (If a user is on a blacklisted page, it will wait till they navigate to a non blacklisted page to update)
    * Wait To Update Till The User is Idle ( x number of seconds without interacting with the app)

    Or All of the above, they can all be used in conjunction with one another.
